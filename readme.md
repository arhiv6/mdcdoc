# C/C++ Header to Markdown converter (*mdcdoc*)

Small utility for generating markdown file from block comments in C/C++ source code.

```cpp
library.h  â†’  [mdcdoc]  â†’  documentation.md
```

Basic idea is that you already have markdown text in block comment of your code and you want to take them into separate file.

**Use the [JavaDoc](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html#writingdoccomments) syntax for proper functioning**

## Sample Comment

### Input

```cpp
/**
 * # Constructor
 */

/**
  * Constructor for the Dummy class
  * @param foo this is foo
  * @param bar this is bar
  * @return new `Dummy` object
  */
```

### Output

---

## ðŸ’¡ Dummy(uint8_t foo, uint8_t bar)

Constructor for the Dummy class

```cpp
Dummy(uint8_t foo, uint8_t bar)
```

**Params:**

- `foo` - this is foo
- `bar` - this is bar

**Returns:**

- new `Dummy` object

## Examples

- [timer.h](https://github.com/forntoh/mdcdoc/blob/master/examples/timer.h) â†’ [timer.md](https://github.com/forntoh/mdcdoc/blob/master/examples/timer.md) (C++ header)
- [simple.h](https://github.com/forntoh/mdcdoc/blob/master/examples/simple.h) â†’ [simple.md](https://github.com/forntoh/mdcdoc/blob/master/examples/simple.md) (C header)

## Usage

Get application. Requires *node.js* and *npm* to be installed on computer.

Use npx if you don't want to store the package locally.

```bash
npx mdcdoc -p cpp -o documentation.md library.h
                            â†‘             â†‘
                       destination     header file
```

## Theory of operation

mdcdoc works in 3 steps:

1. Take block comment (beginning with `/**`) from file plus one following line of code.
2. Apply patterns to block according to that one line of code (if not empty). Patterns are in [libs](https://github.com/forntoh/mdcdoc/tree/master/lib/patterns).
3. Go block by block and
    - If code line is empty, just put content of block to output file.
    - If code line is not empty, make md header from it and then put content of block.
